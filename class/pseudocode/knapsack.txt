Each requests i has both a value vi and a weight wi

Max V, subject to not exceed W

To find out the value for OPT(n), we not only need the value of OPT(n-1), but we also
need to know the best solution we can get using a subset of the first n-1 items and total
allowed weight W-Wn
We will have a subproblem for each i =0,1,...n and each integer 0<=w<=W
Use OPT(i,w) to denote the value of the optimal solution using a subset of the items
{1,...i} with maximum allowed weight w
